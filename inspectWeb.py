# Initiating our request to the desired domain

# Creating our variable to store the response as text and to use the HTML parser

# printing title of page with some formatting

# Using a for loop to say if the href value is NOT equal to NONE, then check if 'https' is in that link - if it
# is, print the link to the screen.
